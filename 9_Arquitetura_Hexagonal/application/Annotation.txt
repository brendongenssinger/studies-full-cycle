Let me explain the key components of this Go project that implements a Hexagonal Architecture pattern for product management:

1. **Core Domain (product.go)**:
- Defines the main `Product` struct with fields like ID, Name, Price, and Status
- Implements business rules through methods like:
  - `Enable()`: Product can only be enabled if price > 0
  - `Disable()`: Product can only be disabled if price = 0
  - `IsValid()`: Validates product attributes
- Defines key interfaces:
  - `ProductInterface`: Core product behavior
  - `ProductServiceInterface`: Service layer operations
  - `ProductReader`/`ProductWriter`: Persistence operations

2. **Service Layer (product_service.go)**:
- Implements business operations using `ProductService` struct
- Provides methods for:
  - Creating new products
  - Enabling/disabling products
  - Getting product by ID
- Uses dependency injection for persistence

3. **Tests**:
- `product_test.go`: Unit tests for Product entity behavior
- `product_service_test.go`: Tests service layer using mocks
- Uses `gomock` for mocking dependencies

4. **Mock Generation (application.go)**:
- Auto-generated mock implementations of interfaces
- Used for testing in isolation

5. **Architecture Notes (Anotacoes.md)**:
- Documents key architectural principles
- Emphasizes:
  - Sustainable growth
  - Well-defined boundaries
  - Component isolation
  - Scalability
  - Preparation for changes

The project follows Hexagonal Architecture principles by:
- Separating core domain logic from external concerns
- Using interfaces for dependency inversion
- Enabling easy testing through mocks
- Maintaining clear boundaries between layers

This architecture makes the system more maintainable, testable, and adaptable to change.
